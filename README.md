## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Custom Properties
- CSS Flex
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working with SVGs is a Pain?? I couldn't figure out the overflow ðŸ™ƒ Although, I am proud of the fact that I used JS to add in the stars instead of hardcoding them!!

### Continued development

I need to look up some resources specifically targeted to using SVGs. Something like an SVGpedia?

### Useful resources

I had to dip into the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) because I somehow forgot the grid shorthand LMAO
